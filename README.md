Repository for - Elevate: AAPI Data Challenge 

[About the Challenge](http://sites.ed.gov/aapi/elevate-aapi-data-challenge/)

The White House Initiative on Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders (WHIAAPI), which is housed within the Department of Education, and University of California, Riverside (AAPIData.com) are sponsoring this challenge to hear from the public about novel approaches to analyzing, interpreting, and presenting data about AAPIs, particularly data that are broken out by detailed origin (such as Cambodian, Korean, Native Hawaiian, etc.).  Submissions may include, for example: policy papers that rely on identified AAPI data sets or subsets, compelling infographics, web applications, data tables, blog posts, animations, videos, and other creative mediums. What can you tell or show us about the AAPI community through data?

Data Source:
[National Science Foundation dataset on women, minorities, and persons with disabilities in science and engineering](http://1.usa.gov/19pfJSl)

The review panel will consider criteria such as the following:

__Topical Relevance:__ 
Does the application address Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, either as racial groups, or with reference to any particular detailed origin group (such as Cambodian, Filipino, Samoan, etc.)?

__Soundness of Methodology:__ 
For example, if the product manipulates a dataset to make the data more useful, we are interested in learning about what datasets would be used, and how the application would work so it can be replicated.

__Relevance to Policy Audiences:__ 
For example, does the application identify an issue that should be of concern to government agencies or other policy actors at the federal, state, or local level?

__Accessibility to General Audiences:__ 
For example, is the application accessible to audiences that may not be well versed in statistical methods or analyses?

__Novelty:__
For example, does the application showcase data in a way that is unique?
