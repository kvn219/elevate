# Elevate: AAPI Data Challenge 
___

## [About the Challenge](http://sites.ed.gov/aapi/elevate-aapi-data-challenge/)

The White House Initiative on Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders (WHIAAPI), which is housed within the Department of Education, and University of California, Riverside (AAPIData.com) are sponsoring this challenge to hear from the public about novel approaches to analyzing, interpreting, and presenting data about AAPIs, particularly data that are broken out by detailed origin (such as Cambodian, Korean, Native Hawaiian, etc.).  Submissions may include, for example: policy papers that rely on identified AAPI data sets or subsets, compelling infographics, web applications, data tables, blog posts, animations, videos, and other creative mediums. What can you tell or show us about the AAPI community through data?
