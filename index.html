				The science and engineering (S&E) workforce is composed largely of people who earned S&E degrees over roughly four decades. Because older cohorts of S&E workers are disproportionately white and male, women and minorities constitute a smaller percentage
				of the overall S&E workforce than of degree recipients who recently joined the workforce. Persons with disabilities are also underrepresented in the S&E workforce, compared with the college-educated population as a whole. Disability can occur throughout
				one's life. Disabilities acquired at birth or at an early age may influence decisions to pursue S&E studies; those acquired at later ages may influence opportunities to continue or seek employment.
