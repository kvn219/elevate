The science and engineering (S&E) workforce is composed largely of people who earned S&E degrees over roughly four decades. Because older cohorts of S&E workers are disproportionately white and male, women and minorities constitute a smaller percentage of the overall S&E workforce than of degree recipients who recently joined the workforce or across the college-educated population as a whole. Likewise, persons with disabilities make up a smaller share of S&E employees even though disability can occur throughout one's life; disabilities acquired at birth or an early age is a possible influence on decisions to pursue S&E studies while disabilities acquired at later ages shape opportunities to continue or to seek employment.

By visualizing data from the National Science Foundation’s 2015 report “Women, Minorities, and Persons with Disabilities in Science and Engineering,” we attempted to gain a better comprehension of the influence of S&E education on employment. Understanding this relationship has far-reaching implications for educational funding; intuitively, we assume that state governments would prefer to allocate funding the fields most likely to result in employment. 

Thanks to pstuffa, our graph conveys the distribution of the S&E workforce as compiled by survey data from the National Science Foundation (NSF) from 2013. To isolate for science and engineering, we used only numbers from rows 10 through 50 of the excel file, which are subheadings of the designated S&E occupations. Each bar represents an S&E occupation that is color coded by educational background or degree. In addition to visualizing the dataset of S&E employees by area of expertise, we added an interactive feature categorizing employment findings based on racial or ethnic background.

Readers will notice that the graph heavily skews towards workers in the field of computer and information science, which makes up over 2.3 million of the 5.6 million S&E workforce. S&E workers in biology and life sciences come closest to computer science workers, yet computer science and information workers outnumber them by nearly four to one. This pattern holds up across all racial categories, with computer and information science workers making up anywhere from 40-50 percent of all S&E workers. 

However, the occupational data starkly contrasts with the composition of S&E degree holders, who earned degrees across a more diverse set of fields, typically favoring psychology or biology graduates over computer science ones. Survey data from 2002-2012 on bachelor’s, master’s, and doctoral degree holders show that less than a quarter of S&E students studied computer science, with the bulk of students focusing on biology and life sciences. 

If computer and information science employees are overrepresented in S&E employment, should this finding make us reconsider how we define degrees in engineering, biology, and other S&E fields? Conversely, does this finding raise concerns about how we define technology or computer occupations? 

This preoccupation with computer science reminded us of the on-going popularity of computer technology in culture and business. For starters, four American companies designated as tech claimed a place among the four most valuable companies in early August. Yet tech is often used a shorthand for a computer technology company and computers and technology have a role across all industries. To clarify this, future surveys could ascertain data on what type of organizations employ S&E workers, including whether or not they work for a start up that makes mobile applications or work in information technology for a government agency, transportation service, or heath care provider. 

There’s also the possibility that biology and life science degree holders went on to become medical school students, a fact that could be shown in S&E-related occupations that we excluded from the analysis. Unfortunately, the NSF survey data does not allow us to make such predictions given the limitations of the data. Our graphic is simply an ad-hoc description of one point in time that we hope might illustrate what the S&E field looked like in 2013, which — along with educational data that tracks patterns over time — might inform us on the composition of the S&E workforce in the coming years like 2020.
